# Observability Setup

This sample installs **Prometheus** and **Grafana** for observability in your Kubernetes cluster. This folder contains a Helm chart that sets up these components with Traefik ingress and cert-manager as dependencies for ingress and TLS management.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/) installed
- Traefik ingress controller installed (From coreweave docs)
- Cert-manager installed (From coreweave docs)

## Components

- **Prometheus**: Collects and stores metrics from your cluster and workloads.
- **Grafana**: Visualizes metrics and dashboards.

**NOTE**: This installation of Prometheus has most of the [kube-prometheus-stack](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack) chart components disabled. That is intentional to keep the setup simple and focused on basic observability needs. If you plan to make this your main observability stack, you should evaluate enabling more components by modifying the `values.yaml` or `hack/values.yaml` file as needed.

## Installation

### 1. **Add Helm repositories** (if needed):

```sh
helm repo add coreweave https://charts.core-services.ingress.coreweave.com
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo add grafana https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
```

### 2. **Install the dependency charts**:
You need to install Traefik and cert-manager before installing this chart. If you haven't done so, follow the instructions in the CoreWeave documentation to install Traefik and cert-manager.

First install Traefik:
```sh
helm install traefik coreweave/traefik --namespace traefik --create-namespace
```

Then install cert-manager (this needs to happen in two steps):
```sh
helm install cert-manager coreweave/cert-manager --namespace cert-manager --create-namespace
helm upgrade cert-manager coreweave/cert-manager --namespace cert-manager --set cert-issuers.enabled=true 
```

If you haven't already, get the dependencies for this chart:

```sh
helm dependency build
```

### 3. **Install this chart**:
The default values won't work out of the box because you need to add `CLUSTER_ORG` and `CLUSTER_NAME` in your overrides. You can do this by replacing the placeholder values in [hack/values.yaml](./hack/values.yaml) file and using that file in the install command (as shown below in this guide), or overriding them with another file or command line arguments.

#### [OPTIONAL] Exposing Prometheus externally
If you want to enable external access to query metrics from a source outside your cluster (i.e., not the cluster Grafana), you'll need to set the `prometheus.externalAccess.enabled` value to true and update the credentials (unless you want to keep the default ones). The default values are username `admin` and password `cwadmin`. You can set it in the `values.yaml` file under `prometheus.externalAccess.credentials`; however, it needs to be hashed. To hash one yourself, you can run the following command in any machine (you can install `htpasswd` by intalling the `apache2-utils` package on Debian/Ubuntu or `httpd-tools` on CentOS/RHEL):

```sh
USERNAME=admin
PASSWORD=cwadmin
htpasswd -nb $USERNAME $PASSWORD
```

This will output a hashed password that you can use in your `values.yaml` file.

Note that you don't need to set the `prometheus.externalAccess.enabled` value if you only want to see metrics in the Grafana instance we will deploy with this sample.

#### Install the chart with your custom values
Once your values are set, you can install the chart with:

```sh
helm install observability ./ --namespace monitoring --create-namespace --values ./hack/values.yaml
```

> Replace `./` with the path to this chart if running from a different directory.

4. **Access Grafana**:

The chart creates an Ingress for Grafana using Traefik and TLS is managed by cert-manager.

To get the password for the `admin` user in Grafana, you must run the following command (this will get you the password):
```sh
kubectl get secret observability-grafana -n monitoring -o=jsonpath='{.data.admin-password}' | base64 --decode; echo
```
You need to go to the Grafana UI at the deployed endpoint and enter the username `admin` with the password returned by the command above.

To get the endpoint, run the following command:
```sh
kubectl get ingress observability-grafana -n monitoring -o=jsonpath='{.spec.rules[0].host}'; echo
```
Then go to the endpoint in your browser and log in.

**NOTE**: This assumes you used the default namespace `monitoring` and default release name `observability`. If you used different values, update the commands.

## Configuration

You can customize values in `values.yaml` to suit your environment.

## Cleaning up

To remove the chart:
```sh
helm uninstall observability --namespace monitoring
```

To remove the monitoring namespace:
```sh
kubectl delete namespace monitoring
```

To remove Traefik and cert-manager, you can run:
```sh
helm uninstall traefik --namespace traefik
helm uninstall cert-manager --namespace cert-manager
kubectl delete namespace traefik
kubectl delete namespace cert-manager
```
